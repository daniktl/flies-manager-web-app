# fly_manager

SQL project with Python SQLAlchemy module and Flask back-frontend

To run it you need to install next packages with pip:

    1) Flask
    2) SQLAlchemy (not now but in future)
    3) mysql package for python
    
Next from the main directory run it using `python3 main.py` if you're using Ubuntu. Or just open project in PyCharm and run it as normal script.
